            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>
                We are UCI CanSat, an undergraduate project in the MAE department. Our team competes 
                in the CanSat competition, an annual, international engineering challenge to design 
                and build a space-type system. Every year the mission changes so this year's objective 
                is to build a probe that can be deployed at an altitude of around 700m, transmit telemetry 
                in real-time, and use a parachute and aerobraking heat shield to land safely at an upright 
                orientation which is signaled by a victory flag. Interested students are advised to read 
                the official mission guide for 2022-2023 here. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to meeting our competition 
                objectives, our team's goals are to provide all members with hands-on experience with 
                the process of engineering design. Over three quarters, we'll go from brainstorming and 
                concept generation, to launching our flight hardware at the competition! We are a small 
                team where everyone has a critical part to play.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Last year, UCI CanSat consisted of ten Engineering and Computer Science students led by our faculty adviser, Professor Roger Rangel. This year we plan to keep our team restricted to 10 students, the maximum allowed by competition rules.

                        Our team consists of undergraduate students from various disciplines at UCI,
                        including Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering,
                        Computer Science and Engineering, Computer Science, and Business Information Management.
                        The team is divided into specialized groups such as Mechanical, Electrical, and Controls,
                        as well as a team for website development and operations.

                    <p class="testimonial-paragraph">"CanSat is an invaluable experience that broadened my technical skills significantly. From mastering new technologies through designing the satellite's software to honing leadership abilities through team coordination and project management, every aspect of the endeavor pushed me to grow. Most importantly, tackling real-world problems within the project context not only deepened my understanding of engineering principles but also made me apply and deploy my technical skills effectively, preparing me for future challenges in the field."</p>

I enjoyed the creativity involved in the design process and the hands on manufacturing and testing experience. Getting to experience an engineering competition and compete against great teams from around the world was very exciting. Although fast paced and stressful at times, I had a great time and learned a lot."</p>

From CAD to testing the prototype, every stage was full of challenges and unexpected surprises. We even melted the prototype a week before the competition! However, anything can be accomplished with a team full of ambitious individuals. Joining CanSat was more than just an engineering project; it was a journey of personal and collective growth. Join CanSat for an experience you won’t regret."</p>
