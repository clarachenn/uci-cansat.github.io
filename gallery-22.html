                        The fall quarter consisted mostly of researching and design work, where we worked to 
                        complete the design for prototyping the preliminary design report which is additional 
                        documentation that the team needs to complete for the competition. Software development 
                        focused on creating a ground station capable of receiving and displaying telemetry 
                        data from the CanSat’s sensors, while hardware focused on having electrical and 
                        mechanical prototype designs for the following quarter to test.

                        Winter quarter was dedicated to practicing our presentation for the Competitions Preliminary 
                        Design Review (PDR). All subteams worked focused on their forces to complete the presentation
                        and practice presentation times.

                        This Spring quarter involved us finally taking all our research and designing over 
                        the past year and implementing them into a physical solution. Electrical components 
                        were ordered, container segments were printed and assembled, and the various performances 
                        of our design were tested to verify requirements compliance.

                    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                    <p>
                        Telemetry is an automated communication process in which measurements of data are taken 
                        remotely for monitoring and recording. History of telemetry in aerospace can be traced 
                        back to the 1930s with the invention of balloon-borne radiosonde. Since then, size and 
                        complexity of aerospace telemetry systems have grown significantly, and such systems 
                        are commonly used in rapidly moving vehicles.

                        The CanSat competition, sponsored by the American Astronautical Society (AAS), 
                        offers student competitors to be involved in the complete life cycle for the 
                        development of a telemetry reporting payload system. University students are 
                        to design and build a system, complying with a set of competition guidelines, 
                        and compete at the end Spring quarter.

                    <p>
                        Design a container that will be stored in and deployed from a rocket. 
                        The container should have predetermined descent rates based on altitude, 
                        controlled by a total of 2 parachutes: at above 400m, the container 
                        should descend at 15m/s, at below 400m, the container should descend at 5m/s.
                        At 300m, the container should deploy a payload, attached to the container 
                        by a tether and consisting of a camera, at a decent rate of 0.5m/s, until 
                        the payload is 10m away from the container. The camera from the payload should 
                        face South and 45 degrees below the horizon at all times.
                        The container should report telemetry while descending.

                <div>
                    <h3>MAJOR COMPONENTS</h3>
                    <p>
                        The overall design consists of three key components in order for the CanSat 
                        to function effectively. They are separated into the three parts that make 
                        up the CanSat.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The first part of the CanSat is the top cap. The purpose of the top cap is to 
                                stow both the first and second parachutes for deployment at their specific 
                                altitudes in order to slow down the descent rate of the CanSat. The key 
                                component in the top cap is the secondary parachute deployment mechanism.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The second part is the body. Is it the middle cylinder that connects both 
                                the top cap and the payload (third component). It is the largest part which 
                                is used to house the pulley system, the key component of the body, which is 
                                used to deploy the payload via 10 meter long tether(s).
                            </p>

                                The third part is its own key component: the payload. The payload is the 
                                “cargo” of the CanSat which sits at the bottom of the CanSat. It houses a
                                camera that requires a very specific orientation (cardinal direction and angle) 
                                along with its necessary electronics.
                            </p>

                    <h3>TOP CAP SELECTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first parachute sits atop of Top Cap while tied to it. The first 
                        parachute deploys naturally as it falls out of the rocket when it separates 
                        via ejection charges. The top cap must be able to house the second parachute 
                        until its specified deployment time, along with the electronics needed to 
                        power the mechanism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the first parachute sits above, the second chute is held down by a lid 
                        with a spring hinge mechanism. In order to hold down the lid, either nichrome 
                        wire or a solenoid were debated being used. Given that the solenoid and nichrome 
                        wire had similar traits, but the solenoid offered better strength and reusability, 
                        the solenoid was chosen for our second parachute deployment mechanism.

                    <h3>BODY</h3>
                    <p>
                        The body is the largest part of the CanSat. The pulley system is housed here 
                        along with its electronics i.e. servos, circuits, battery. The pulley system is 
                        an important component for CanSat as its job is to lower the payload 10 meters 
                        down with tethers.  When the pulley system is active, the CanSat will be descending 
                        at a rate of 5 m/s (+/- 2 m/s) and wind will be the main factor contributing to 
                        instability of the CanSat. Due to this, stability is a high priority factor for 
                        the payload. This can be accomplished with a four tether system. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: oblique;">
                        Figure: Front views of two different pulley systems in the container body. 
                        Both incorporate four tether designs in order to maximize stability when the 
                        payload descends.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="gallery/22-items/body.png" alt="CanSat Body Image">
            </div>
            <p>
                A significant concern with the pulley system is the possibility of the tethers tangling while 
                they descend. In order to prevent this, the four tethers need to be independent from each other 
                to minimize interaction. Both designs With four tethers, the possibility of each individual 
                tether spinning is reduced. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The design on the left utilizes one “spool” to wrap all four tethers which is powered by 
                a servo motor. The benefit with this is that there is less weight required for the pulley 
                system meaning less torque required for the servo motor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The right design utilizes four spools where each tether runs through. The benefit with this
                 is that each tether is isolated and spread apart across four points, improving stability for 
                 the payload descent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Modifications and improvements are continuing to be made for the pulley system. As the 
                project is still in the preliminary stages, different concepts are being experimented with. 
                For example, the use of four smaller servos powering four spools is an idea that is being considered.

                    <h3>PAYLOAD</h3>
                    <p>
                        The payload is another important component for the CanSat. Our goal is to 
                        ensure that the camera installed must face 45° downwards, due South. Evidently, 
                        the payload must have a wide space for the electronics to be mounted. Preferably, 
                        the payload should be light in order to reduce the load on the pulley system. 
                        The camera's view should be obstructed as little as possible to ensure a wide 
                        viewing angle. Additionally, the camera and its electronics must be able to survive 
                        the impact during landing completely intact. Due to these reasons, special attention 
                        was placed on the payload’s design.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: oblique;">
                        Figure: Two payload designs. Both utilize two servos that control pitch and 
                        yaw of the camera with a rotating plate for the cardinal direction and a lever 
                        for the angle control.
